## Maybe You Overlooked It

I'm not the genius here. If you're a programmer
and missed the fact that any programming language
was another application software it's probably
because you gave no thought to it. Pointers along
the way that you missed: as part of setting up
your workstation, you (say this slowly)
**installed** your favorite programming languages.
If you didn't have to (because they were already
installed as part of your operating system), you
have every right to not have made the association
between a programming language and a web browser,
or any other application software.
